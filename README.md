# BCBA Session Notes Generator

This project uses GPT-4 to help BCBAs generate detailed notes for therapy sessions. The user can choose between two types of sessions, "Direct" and "Indirect", and provide details about the session. The application will then use GPT-4 to generate a professional note for the session.
